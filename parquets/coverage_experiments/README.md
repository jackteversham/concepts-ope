<!-- - All coverage experiments used an epsilon of 0.8 with replacement evaluation distribution [0.25,0.25,0.4,0.1] for states < -2,-2; forcing the agent into concept four (purple) -->

## ope_estimates_good_coverage
- uses full dataset (through all concepts)
- eval_dist: [0.4,0.1,0.45,0.05] , epsilon: 0.7
- trials per dataset: 50

## ope_estimates_bad_coverage
- uses dataset through concepts 0,1,2,3
- eval_dist: [0.4,0.1,0.45,0.05] , epsilon: 0.7
- trials per dataset: 50
